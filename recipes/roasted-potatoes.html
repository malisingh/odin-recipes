    <h2>Roasted Red Potatoes</h2>
    <p>
      This red skin potato recipe is a go-to side dish. You have to do only a
      few things, and if you do those things, we're talking intense potato side
      dish pleasure! The best roasted red potatoes start with a heavy roasting
      pan, a generous amount of olive oil, and enough time to roast the potatoes
      until dark and rich.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil, or more if needed</li>
      <li>2 pounds red potatoes, cut into evenly sized pieces</li>
      <li>½ large red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>5 fresh thyme sprigs, or to taste</li>
      <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Pour olive oil into a heavy baking dish (such as an enameled cast iron
        dish). Place potatoes into the baking dish and toss to coat. Sprinkle
        with red bell pepper, thyme sprigs, kosher salt, black pepper, and
        cayenne pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Toss vegetables to turn over.
        Some potatoes may stick; don't try to turn them. Return to the oven and
        bake for 20 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss vegetables again, turning potatoes so the unbrowned sides come into
        contact with the bottom of the dish. Continue baking until potatoes are
        browned and tender, about 15 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the oven off and leave potatoes in the oven for 15 more minutes.
        Toss once more. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper
        before transferring to a serving bowl.
      </li>
    </ol>
